This package contains functions to assign and use data labels in an easy and efficient way. With an easy to share structure.

## Installation


<!-- You can install the released version of labeler from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- install.packages("labeler") -->
<!-- ``` -->

`labeler` is not available in CRAN.

But you can install the development version from [Adatar's r-universe](https://adatar.r-universe.dev/ui#builds) with:

```r
install.packages(
  "labeler", 
  repos = 
    c(
      "https://adatar-do.r-universe.dev", 
      "https://cloud.r-project.org"
    )
  )
```

## Roadmap

- [ ] Pattern ("link::") to reuse labels between variables.
- [ ] ¿Read and write Dict objects to and from JSON files?

### Converting from old dictionaries

## Converting old dictionaries

The `link::` syntax for linking labels between variables is **not supported** in the new `Dict` format. When converting an old dictionary using `as.Dict()`, any instances of `link::` will be **ignored**, and a warning will be issued. 

It's crucial to **update your old dictionaries** to the new format by explicitly defining the `label` and `labels` for each variable. See the documentation for `Dict()` and the examples in the vignette for guidance on creating valid dictionaries. Failing to update your dictionaries may lead to unexpected behavior.

You can convert old dictionaries to the new format using `as.Dict()`.

```r
old_dict <- list(...) # Ejemplo de diccionario antiguo

new_dict <- as.Dict(old_dict, metadata = list(name = "converted_dict"))
new_dict
```
